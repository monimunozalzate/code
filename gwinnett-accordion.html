      <p>
        The pneumococcal vaccine protects people against pneumococcal, a
        contagious disease caused by a type of bacteria that can lead to serious
        infections in the lungs (pneumonia), lining of the brain and spinal cord
        (meningitis), blood (bacteremia), and sepsis.<br /><br />
        Anyone can get diagnosed with pneumococcal disease, and people can get
        pneumococcal disease more than once. A previous pneumococcal infection
        will not protect you from future infections. Getting vaccinated is the
        best way to prevent pneumococcal disease, and the CDC recommends
        vaccination even if you've had the disease in the past.

        The Shingrix (Shingles) vaccine protects against shingles and PHN. This

        the CDC, about 1 out of every 3 people develop shingles in their
        lifetime in the United States. As the risk of shingles increases as you

        The Tdap vaccine is meant to protect against tetanus, diphtheria, and
        pertussis. These are spreadable diseases that can cause tremendous pain
        and serious health problems like heart failure, whooping cough, and
        paralysis. According to TheTdapGAP, only 31.2% of adults older than 19
        have received the vaccination. That’s why it is so important to
        encourage adults to roll up their sleeves and protect themselves from
        these diseases. <br /><br />CDC recommends diphtheria, tetanus, and
        whooping cough (pertussis) vaccination for everyone, but you should talk
        with your doctor if you have questions about diphtheria, tetanus, and
        whooping cough vaccines.

        The Hepatitis A vaccine protects against hepatitis A virus which is a

      <p>
        Hepatitis B is a serious disease caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV)
        that attacks the liver; it can lead to lifelong infection, liver cancer,
        liver failure, and death. Pregnant women diagnosed with hepatitis B can
        pass the virus to their children. There is no cure, but vaccination
        prevents HBV infection as well as the chronic liver damage and cancer
        that hepatitis B can cause. Hepatitis B vaccine is available for all age
        groups, and the CDC recommends that adults aged 19 through 59 years, and
        adults age 60 years or older with risk factors for hepatitis B
        infection, get the vaccine.

      <br />
      <ul style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 22px">
        <li>
          <b>MEASLES (M)</b> causes fever, cough, runny nose, and red watery
          eyes. It is also commonly followed by a rash that covers the whole
          body. It can lead to seizures, ear infections, diarrhea, and
          pneumonia. People with measles are also at risk of brain damage or
          death.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>MUMPS (M)</b> causes fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, loss
          of appetite, and swollen and tender salivary glands. It can lead to
          deafness, swelling of the brain and/or spinal cord covering, painful
          swelling of the testicles or ovaries, and, very rarely, death.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          <b>RUBELLA (R)</b> causes fever, sore throat, rash, headache, and eye
          irritation. It can cause arthritis in up to half of teenage and adult
          women. If a person gets rubella while pregnant, they could have a
          miscarriage, or the baby could be born with serious birth defects.

        The CDC also states MMR vaccination is 97% effective against measles,
        88% effective against mumps, 97% effective against rubella, and most
        people who are vaccinated with MMR will be protected for life.

      <p>
        According to the U.S. Department of Health, vaccines go through stages
        to approve their safety for the public. It’s been tested in labs for
        years to make sure that it has the proper safety and dosages.
        <br /><br />
        The FDA licenses the vaccine while the CDC decides whether to approve
        the recommendation for people. Once the CDC Director approves the
        recommendation, it becomes the official CDC public health guidance for
        safe use of the vaccine in the United States.

        <br /><br />
        Before getting any vaccine, it’s important to speak with your medical
        provider about which vaccines to take to avoid the risk of allergy or
        unnecessary dosages.

      <p>
        Although the choice is ultimately your own, there are many reasons to
        get vaccinated. Vaccines keep people healthy and safe from preventable
        diseases. They can mean the difference between life and death. The CDC
        recommends the use of vaccines for protection against infections
        throughout life. <br /><br />
        Though vaccines may not eliminate diseases entirely, they provide
        powerful protection against illness and decrease the risk of outbreaks
        within our community.

      <p>How do vaccines work?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="answerFaq" id="answerFaq4">
      <p>
        Vaccines help people protect themselves from preventable diseases. The
        way vaccines works are by creating an imitation of the actual infection,
        which will allow the body to learn how to create immunity. So if a
        person were to be exposed to a certain illness, their body will already
        have immunity against that disease or virus, thanks to the vaccine. For
        more information on how vaccines work, click on the link.

      <p>Why do some vaccines need multiple doses like a booster shot?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="answerFaq" id="answerFaq5">
      <p>
        Just like a vaccine booster, a second or third dose of a vaccine
        establishes a firmer hold of the body’s ability to protect itself
        against a disease or virus. However, some vaccines weaken over time,
        causing the need for another dosage.
        <br /><br />Other times, like the flu vaccine, there is a different
        variant of the disease or virus which can infect people, causing the
        need for another shot.

      <p>Can I be infected with COVID-19 and influenza at the same time?</p>

    <div class="answerFaq" id="answerFaq6">
      <p>
        Yes, it's possible to be infected with both COVID-19 and the flu at the
        same time. However, the most effective way to prevent hospitalization
        and severe illness is by receiving vaccines for both.<br /><br />
        Additionally, wearing a facemask when you're sick, maintaining physical
        distance, avoiding crowded and poorly ventilated spaces, opening windows
        and doors to ensure proper ventilation, and practicing frequent hand
        hygiene can help protect you from getting sick and others as well.
